# Description and Motivation
<p>
 This is my first Project in Data Science nanodegree in Udacity. I decide to analysis the data of AirBNB in Boston since I did wanna     know more about boston and also the bussines of airbnnb
 you would find blog post of my analysis at https://medium.com/@mosbad99/3-insights-from-bostons-airbnb-dataset-for-2017-1bacef68136f
and aslo you can find my and technical analysis at https://github.com/Badran98/AIRBNB-BOSTON

so my business understanding was developed through the analysis and I found as I wanna get tips to look at before listings units on Airbnb
What did I extracted from the Boston AirBNB dataset ?
The questions I found interesting before diving into the data was as follows:

- what is Boston's  revenue forcast during year ?  
- How much users are satisfaed with lisitngs's price and what they paying  ? 
- Are listing's price effected it's frequency use ?
</p>


# Data Understanding 
<p>

 I extracted the data of Boston Airbnb Open Data from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston/activity : As part of the Airbnb Inside       initiative it contains the following:


### datasets:
- Listings: including full descriptions and  reviews score from many prospectives  
- Reviews:including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments  
- Calendar:including listing id and the price and availability for that day
</p>

## Prepare Data
<p>
 I did type manipulation for 3 datasets 
 and used only featuers which support my questions 
</p>

# The answers I find is followings:
 <p>
  - we can relate the revinue with boston travel Boston Travel Seasons - High (May-October),Low (November-February) and - Shoulder         (March-April) with low seasons highest earings  .

  - with 99% rating socore between 9 '56.6% 'and 10 '33%' and I tryed to that the value satcifaction doesn't depend on listing price

   - I found that 80% of year uses was listeded for less than 200$
