<p>
This is my first Project in Data Science nanodegree in Udacity. I decide to analysis the data of AirBNB in Boston since I did wanna know more about boston and also the bussines of airbnnb . The Questions I want to address is:

- what is Boston's  revenue forcast during year  ?  
- How much users are satisfaed with lisitngs's price and what they paying  ? 
- Are listing's price effected it's frequency use ?

</p>

# The answers I find is followings:
 </p>
- we can relate the revinue with boston travel Boston Travel Seasons - High (May-October),Low (November-February) and - Shoulder (March-April) with low seasons highest earings  .

- with 99% rating socore between 9 '56.6% 'and 10 '33%' and I tryed to that the value satcifaction doesn't depend on listing price

 - I found that 80% of year uses was listeded for less than 200$
